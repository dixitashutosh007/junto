## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Club House Platform — AI Agent Guide & Architecture Blueprint

This document serves as the single source of truth for AI coding agents, autonomous contributors, and sibling applications (Community, Marketplace, Lessons/Classes, Review) interacting with the **Club House** ecosystem.

---

## 1. Product Ecosystem & Vision

**Club House** (formerly Junto, and before that Saath) is the parent app: a multi-tenant platform for gated residential apartment societies and communities. It eliminates commercial friction, high commission aggregator charges, and stranger safety risks by providing verified, closed-loop co-resident products.

Naming: users see **Club House** as the app and **RideShare** as a sub-app (`src/lib/brand.ts`). Internal identifiers such as the `junto_session` cookie, storage keys and the repository name keep the old name so sessions survive.

### Suite of Community Apps:
1. **RideShare (Active / V1 Pilot)**, a sub-app of Club House: Peer-to-peer co-resident carpooling to tech parks, offices, and metro hubs. Strict zero commercial fares, zero in-app payment rails. Optional fuel sharing calculations (mileage & distance points) handled in-person.
2. **Community (Next Phase)**: Resident directory, interest clubs, building discussions, and neighborhood circles (excluding society circulars).
3. **Marketplace (Next Phase)**: Secure peer-to-peer household buy, sell, and rent platform for verified neighbors.
4. **Lessons / Classes (Next Phase)**: In-society classes (yoga, music, tuition, fitness, hobbies) organized and taught by resident teachers.
5. **Review (Next Phase)**: Verified crowd-sourced resident reviews and contacts for domestic staff (maids, cooks, drivers, cleaners), nannies, and local home service vendors.

---

## 2. Security, Authentication & Isolation Rules

### 2.1 Multi-Tenant Isolation
- **Rule**: Every query, mutation, indexing key, or session context MUST be partitioned by `societyId`.
- A user registered or approved in Society A (e.g., `soc-ggh-001`) must never see rides, requests, marketplace items, or directories from Society B (e.g., `soc-pfr-002`).
- Storage keys follow the single-table isolation pattern: `${societyId}#${entityId}`.

### 2.2 Phone Authentication & Gated Onboarding
- **Identity Provider**: Firebase Phone Authentication with SMS OTP verification.
- **Strict Verification Gate**:
  - Entering mobile number checks if user exists and has an approved membership (`ACTIVE`).
  - If new user or profile incomplete: prompts for mandatory onboarding (Full Name, Tower & Flat Number, Email, Gender, Commute Intent).
  - Once submitted, status moves to `PENDING_APPROVAL`.
  - A screen stating **"Verification Pending — Your society admin needs to approve your resident profile before you can access apps"** blocks access to community apps until approved.
- **ZERO Developer Bypass in Production**: No hardcoded mock OTPs (`123456`), no demo bypass buttons, and no unvalidated session tokens.

### 2.3 Strict PII & Contact Disclosure
- Commuter phone numbers, precise flat numbers, and vehicle registration numbers are **strictly masked** (`+91 98*** **233`, `Flat Hidden`, `KA-04-**-****`).
- Full contact details are disclosed **only** after a ride match is explicitly accepted by both parties.
- Token exchange in URL parameters or unauthenticated query strings is strictly prohibited to prevent URL-sharing credential leakage.

---

## 3. Tech Stack & Infrastructure

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack, React 19).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4, Lucide React icons.
- **Database Engine**:
  - Cloud Production: Google Cloud Firestore (Standard/Enterprise). Credentials come from the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` (or `_B64`) environment variable in Amplify; never commit a service-account file. Production refuses to start without them.
  - Local/Testing: `MockDynamoRepository` (`src/lib/db/mock-repository.ts`) with deterministic in-memory indexing and tenant isolation.
  - Abstraction: `ISocietyRepository` interface (`src/lib/db/repository.interface.ts`).
- **Maps & Geocoding**:
  - OpenStreetMap (OSM) / Photon geocoding for cost-free address autocomplete with Bangalore tech park fallback dataset.
  - Google Places API with bounded bounds if configured.
- **Hosting & CI/CD**:
  - GitHub Repo: `https://github.com/dixitashutosh007/junto.git` (main branch).
  - AWS Amplify Hosting: App ID `d2dolgqm6zsfo9` (Region: `ap-south-1`, auto-building on push to `main`).
- **Testing**: Vitest (`npx vitest run`) with automated multi-tenant isolation, route detour, and security tests.

## 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Audit Trails

### Roles:
- **`RESIDENT`**: Regular verified community member (Ride Offerer, Ride Seeker, Marketplace Buyer/Seller, etc.).
- **`SOCIETY_ADMIN`**: Society committee member managing a specific society. Has granular permissions configured:
  - `canApproveResidents`: Approve or reject new onboarding submissions.
  - `canManageSettings`: Update detour tolerances, society coordinates, and community rules.
  - `canModerateReports`: Review safety flags and user complaints.
  - `canViewAuditLogs`: View society activity trail.
- **`SUPER_ADMIN` / Platform App Admin**: Controls platform-wide RBAC, promotes/demotes society admins, manages granular permission flags across societies.

### Dynamic Navigation Menu:
- The UI navigation adapts dynamically according to active role:
  - **Admins** (society and app admins are residents too): see the menu for their ride mode below, plus `Admin`.
  - Every user picks a ride mode (Offer / Find / Both) from the top-bar Role menu, the home screen or their profile.
  - **Ride Offerers**: See `Home`, `Offer Ride`, `My Rides`, `Profile`.
  - **Ride Seekers**: See `Home`, `Find Ride`, `My Requests`, `Profile`.
  - **Both**: See `Home`, `Find Ride`, `Offer Ride`, `Profile`.
  - The menu follows the membership role and the user's commute preference, never a user ID.

### Audit Logging:
- All administrative lifecycle actions (approvals, rejections, suspensions, settings updates, RBAC role modifications) are logged via `recordAuditEvent()` and queryable via `/api/v1/admin/audit-logs`.

---

## 5. Peer-to-Peer Zero Payment Policy

- **Legal Compliance**: Club House is strictly a non-commercial community facilitation tool.
- **No In-App Payments**: The app does **not** process, hold, or escrow money. No payment gateway integration.
- **Fuel Points Estimation**: Fuel sharing or mileage estimates based on commute distance and car mileage are purely informational. Any shared expenses must be settled directly between neighbors in person.

## 7. Instructions for Sibling App Agents

When creating or extending sibling apps (e.g., **Community**, **Marketplace**, **Lessons**, **Review**):
1. **Consume `useAuth()`**: Always rely on `AuthContext` for `society`, `user`, and `membership` status.
2. **Gate on `membership.status === 'ACTIVE'`**: Never render interactive features to users whose status is `PENDING_APPROVAL` or unverified.
3. **Persist within `ISocietyRepository`**: Add new domain methods to the repository interface and implement both mock and Firestore stores with `${societyId}` partitioning.
4. **Run Verification**: `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run lint` and `npm run build` must all pass.
5. **Ship through a pull request**: CI runs the same checks on every PR. Merging to `main` deploys to production through AWS Amplify, so never push straight to `main`.
6. **Follow the project rules in section 8.**

## 8. Project Rules (enforced)

Club House is the parent app for a housing society; RideShare, its first sub-app, lets residents share rides. Read `docs/PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` for the current hardening plan; some rules below describe the target state that the roadmap phases are moving the code towards.

**Stack:** Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, Firebase Phone Auth + Firestore (admin SDK, server-only), Zod 4, Tailwind 4, Vitest. Deployed on AWS Amplify (`amplify.yml`).

**Commands** (all must pass before committing; CI runs them on every PR):
- `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm test`
- `npm run lint` (zero warnings allowed)
- `npm run build`

**Frontend conventions:**
- Call the API with `apiFetch` from `src/lib/api-client.ts` (never hand-build `x-dev-user-id` / `x-society-id` headers); load data with `useApiData`.
- Read the current date or browser-only APIs during render via `useIsClient`, not by copying them into state in an effect.
- Use `Dialog` / `ConfirmDialog` from `src/components/ui/Dialog.tsx` (never `window.confirm`), and `Loading` / `LoadError` for load states.
- Every form control needs a label; icon-only buttons and links need `aria-label`; text must meet WCAG AA contrast (no `*-400` grey text).

**Layout:**
- API routes: `src/app/api/v1/**/route.ts`
- Auth for routes: `src/lib/api-auth.ts` (`requireAuth`); sessions: `src/lib/auth/session.ts`
- Data access only through `getRepository()` (`src/lib/db`); `FirestoreRepository` in production, `MockDynamoRepository` (seeded demo data) in development and tests
- Shared types: `src/types`; request schemas: `src/lib/validation/schemas.ts`
- Route tests: `src/app/api/**/__tests__/*.test.ts`, using `makeRequest` and `resetRepository` from `src/test/route-helpers.ts`; mock Firebase with `src/test/firebase-admin-mock.ts` to test production auth

**Every API route must:**
- Start with `const auth = await requireAuth(req, { statuses?, roles? }); if (auth instanceof NextResponse) return auth;`. It returns 401 when signed out and 403 unless the membership is `ACTIVE` (pass `ONBOARDING_STATUSES` only for onboarding routes).
- Validate the body and query with a Zod schema via `parseBody(req, Schema)` / `parseQuery(req, Schema)` from `src/lib/validation/parse.ts`; never destructure raw `req.json()`.
- Check ownership or role on the target entity (the offerer, the seeker, or an admin of *that* society).
- Admin routes pass `permission: 'canApproveResidents' | 'canManageSettings' | 'canModerateReports' | 'canViewAuditLogs'` to `requireAuth`.
- Return generic error messages (`serverError(context, err)`); never echo `err.message` to the client.
- Have a route test covering the unauthorized and wrong-user cases.

**Security invariants:**
- The server uses the Firestore admin SDK, which bypasses `firestore.rules`; the rules deny all direct client access. The API is the only access-control boundary.
- Dev shortcuts (`x-dev-user-id`, the persona switcher, `dev-token-*` tokens, OTP `123456`, `MockDynamoRepository`) must be unreachable when `NODE_ENV === 'production'`.
- Contact data (mobile, flat number, number plate) is shown only to accepted ride participants, via `formatPublicJourneyView` in `src/lib/services/privacy.ts`.
- Never hardcode a society ID; use `auth.societyId`.
- Never commit secrets; service-account keys stay in Amplify environment variables and never use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

**Data conventions:**
- Seat counts change only through `acceptRideRequest` / `closeRideRequest` / `cancelRideWithRequests`, which apply the rules in `src/lib/services/seat-booking.ts` atomically.
- Times are Asia/Kolkata: use `src/lib/utils/time.ts` (`istDateTime`, `istDateString`, `formatIstTime`); never `toISOString().split('T')[0]` or `toLocaleTimeString` without a time zone.
- IDs come from `crypto.randomUUID()`, not `Date.now()`.
- No placeholder data (flat numbers, distances, coordinates) in production responses; fail or mark the value as unknown.
